UfoBay is intergalactic parsel service. It can deliver your parsel anywhere in the galaxy in a moment. Two days ago this system was used by our enemies (Andromedans) to send a description of a new secret weapon. Our intelligence has found the server which had been used to deliver that parsel, but we cannot get access to that server. Help us to get there and steal important information.
