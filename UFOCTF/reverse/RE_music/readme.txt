Nostalgie has come, and I ordered one programmer to write a program which plays 8 bit music from game consoles. There was a mistake in the program, and music from my favorite game hadn't been played ;( Unfortunately, the programmer was killed, maybe because of his work... Help me to get my favorite song playing. As a proof that you have managed to do that, I need the name of the game (lowercase).
