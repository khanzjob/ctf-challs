You have captured the alien's spaceship in severe and grueling battle. But it is too early to rejoice - in order to use the spaceship you will have to understand how does it work. The military scientists keep silence confusedly. They failed to solve even the most simple problem: there are 16 switchers on the spaceship; the order of turning them on to get the minimum engine thrust is to be determined. You have a program that calculates the value of thrust, depending on the turning order for the switches. The answer - switchers numbers separated by comma.
