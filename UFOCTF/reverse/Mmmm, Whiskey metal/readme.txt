Our special agent was sent to the aliens to work under cover. The operation went well, so the aliens even taught him Windows kernel programming. And they created kernel dump analysis task for him. He says they placed some sensitive information there. We know that they modified his keylogger somehow, and we're sure that driver is already unloaded in virtual PC.
P.S. It is also known that:
- key is SHA256 or decoded string
- Aliens always make "Burp" and like tea.
